      Version control is a management system that helps keep track of the changes you make on your work as a developer. It allows developers to keep track of their work and communicate/collaborate with their teams on larger projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a popular version control software that is used locally on the computer. Because it is local, a developer can access without the internet and push it to a centralized repository when ready. It keeps track of changes if the developer makes commits throughout their work, as long as the activity that warrents untracked status.

    <p>
      GitHub is a popular environment on the internet where developers are able to collaborate remotely on a project. For public repositories, developers can share, contribute to, give feedback, and learn from each others' code.
