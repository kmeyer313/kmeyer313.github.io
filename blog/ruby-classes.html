    <h3>Modernizing Traditions</h3>
    <p>Christmas traditions can be pretty sacred, but the young professionals in the family tend to like making things more efficient with technology. For instance, my mom's side of the family has a grab bag that includes over 100 people. Historically, all the names are printed on paper, cut up, and mixed in a bowl from which everyone pulls from on Thanksgiving. This works just fine and it's always fun to pull the names on Thanksgiving, but of course, the budding programmers in the family know there is an easier way.</p>
    <p>In Ruby, we can write a class for the Raleigh Grab Bag. The class contains the methods and variables that characterize the necessary elements of the tradition. As the list of names may change year to year, the characteristics of the class will remain the same.</p>
