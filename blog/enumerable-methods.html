        <h3>Iteration with Enumerable Methods</h3>
        <p>Alright, Newbs! Time to stretch out this brain again… Hang in there! Christmas break is almost here!</p>
        <p>My dad coincidentally used the word “innumerable” when describing one of his “favorite” politicians when we were talking about politics this week. (I am not here to start a political discourse, so I’ll stop right there with that.) I turned to good old Google to parse out the difference between innumerable and enumerable. What I found makes sense for each word in their separate contexts. Innumerable means so many times it cannot be counted. So from my dad’s perspective, the politician has done something an innumerable amount of times (okay, maybe my dad was exaggerating).</p>
        <p>The idea of innumerable can be a little terrifying in the programming world because if our program runs innumerably, it may crash!? Enumerable is much less intimidating as it describes something that is countable. Enumerate means to mention (a number of things) one by one. In Ruby, enumerable is Ruby’s way of saying that we can get elements out of a collection, one by one, and do something with them. This is incredibly useful for Rubyists!</p>
        <p>To be honest, things get a little confusing when we dig into Ruby and start talking about the difference between <code>Enumerable</code> and <code>Enumerator</code>. Here is a minimal explanation that I gleaned from <a href="https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/44-collections/lessons/96-enumerators-and-enumerables">Ruby Monk</a>. <code>Enumerable</code> is a <code>module</code> (which a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants) used as a <code>mixin</code> that could be used in the class such as <code>Array</code>. It provides a number of enumerators, like <code>.map</code>, <code>.select</code>, <code>.inject</code>… etc. <code>Enumerator</code> is a class of <code>Object</code>. “Enumerators are objects that encapsulate knowledge of how to iterate through a particular collection” (<em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em>, 287). Getting dizzy yet? Our dear friend David A. Black, author of <em>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</em>, mentions that the <code>Enumerable</code> module and the <code>Enumerator</code> class are closely related, so for now we’ll just say, "Okay!" and keep going.</p>
        <p>Any class that uses <code>Enumerable</code> (<code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>) or any class you create that for which you want to include the behaviors of the <code>Enumerable</code>, must have their own definition of <code>.each</code>. <code>.each</code> is a method that is simple enough to learn when first exposed to it through iterators and code blocks. We can call <code>.each</code> on an array, followed by a code block telling it what to do with each element of the array. For example:</p>

        <code>array = [1,2,3,4,5]</code>
        <code>array.each { |e| puts “The block just got handed #{e}.” }</code>

        <p>will provide us an output of:<p/>

          <code><p>The block just got handed 1.</p>
            <p>The block just got handed 2.</p>
            <p>The block just got handed 3.</p>
            <p>The block just got handed 4.</p>
            <p>The block just got handed 5.</p>
            <p>=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</p></code>

            <p>The final line is what each returns, the original array, unchanged. Here is another example of <code>.each</code> that I would like you to pay attention to as I will refer to it in the following example.</p>

            <code><p>array = [1, 2, 3]</p>
              <p>array.each {|x| x*10}</p>
              <p>p array</p>
              <p>=> [1, 2, 3]</p></code>

              <p>Again, the return of the array is unchanged. This was pretty confusing to me as I expected the code block to change the value of each item in the array, but I believe that the code block will only retain its output for the use in a particular method definition. As soon as it uses it, it tosses it and reverts back to the original.</p>

              <p>This isn’t always the case with <code>.each</code> as each class has their own definition of what it does. For example, for a hash, using each can change its original value (remember, in the array, it does not). If we have a hash:</p>

              <code><p>hash = { 1=>1,  2=>2,  3=>3 }</p></code>

              <p>and we call <code>.each</code> on that hash,</p>

              <code><p>hash.each { |k,v| hash[k] = v*10}</p></code>

              <p>the return will be <code>{1=>10, 2=>20, 3=>30}</code>.</p>

              <p>What!? Contrary to the array hash, the original hash has been changed! Tricky. I will not go much deeper into this aspect as that’s about as far as I’ve been able to grasp at the moment. However, the point is, every class has its own, although sometimes very similar, definition of <code>.each</code>. So be mindful of the method you are calling when you switch between classes!</p>

              <p><em>(Shoutout to my Accountability Group who helped clear up some of my misunderstandings about <code>.each</code>. These last few paragraphs above are are based on their examples and are somewhat of a synthesis of what I learned from them. They rock!)</em></p>

              <p>A basic understanding of <code>.each</code> will help us understand how <code>Enumerable</code> methods work. Now I want to zoom into an <code>Enumberable</code> method that I found interesting and learned about more in-depth this week: <code>.find_all</code>.</p>

              <code><p>.find_all</p></code>

              <p>This method will iterate through a collection, such as an array, looking for items that match the condition set in the code block, returning them in a new array. For example, let's say a teacher has a list of students' scores from a test and he wants to know what the lowest scores are. This is how we can use <code>.find_all</code> to iterate through the array and return a new array with only the scores that fit the condition of the code in the block.</p>

              <code><p>test_scores = [100, 95, 78, 63, 88, 92, 44, 30, 98]</p></code>

              <code><p>p test_scores.find_all {|x| x < 60}</p></code>

              <p>Which returns an array <code>[44, 30]</code>.
