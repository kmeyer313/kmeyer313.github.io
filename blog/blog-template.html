    <td><center><h2>2.7 Blog Setup - Mandatory Pairing Challenge Reflection</h2></center>
      <ul>
        <li><em>How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?</em></li>
          <p>This was a great experience for me. I enjoyed discussing our ideas and learning about new elements and approaches to wireframing. It was fun to talk with someone through it and get ideas for other topics to include on my website, such as adding MeetUps I've attended and I am thinking about adding a Travel page to share the impact a few trips I have taken that had on my formation. My pair was a little more experienced with HTML so he was able to drive us more efficiently through the challenge. We still stopped to look up a few things as it was tricky to figure out a way to include the sidebar for Social Networks. We ended up making a table with two columns. I would still like to figure out a better way as I think those are two separate components of the page.</p>
        <li><em>Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?</em></li>
          <p>It definitely helps to have a visual picture of the end goal to guide the coding of the HTML page. We could have done without it but I think it would have taken longer and, especially for the sake of collaboration, it would have been hard to know if we had the same end goal in mind as we decided to work on simlar layouts.</p>
        <li><em>What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?</em></li>
          <p>A good wireframe shows the layout of where content will be on a webpage. Elements such as images (as in the logo) should be represented with an X through them. The different headline sizes denote hierarchy of importance. In retrospect, I think we maybe should have been a little more detailed on some parts of our wireframe, such as including blue underlined text in the Social Networks sidebar to show that there will be links and to put placeholder text in the Blog Text frame.</p>
        <li><em>What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?</em></li>
          <p> - meta charset -"utf-8" is important for specifying the character encoding for the document</p>
          <p> - table style ="width:100%" sets the table to stretch across the whole page</p>
          <p> - em tags will italicize the text</p>
          <p> - to make a copywrite symbol, use the entity <em>"& copy ;"</em> (with no space inbetween the charcters)
        </ul>
