        <h3>Website Check-In</h3>
        <p>It's been about 9 weeks since I first began learning how to create a website from scratch with HTML and CSS. While I have come pretty far and I am somewhat satisfied with my website, I know I have much more to learn.</p>
        <p>I have enjoyed styling the webpage with colors, fonts, and images that give a sense of my personal style. It has been satisfying to learn about and apply certain elements such as the navigation bar, the social media badges, using border-radius, and other fancy features.  </p>
        <p>The most challenging pieces for me continue to be positioning and layering of CSS elements. I have found that I am running into some trouble with styling pages that are further removed from the main index. Styles for sections and asides that I wanted for the homepage carry over to the blog index in a way that is puzzling me. I am struggling to find why the section that contains the list of blog posts is not following the descriptors I have given to the class "blog-posts". I am finding that it may have been better to start using classes and ids from the beginning when I began working on the main page index. Pages that I have developed since then are often pulling descriptors from the main index that I do not want applied. <em>**This problem has been fixed since January 18.</em></p>
        <p>In the process of making this website, I have learned that there are few areas that I need some improvement in: CSS cascade organization (general to specific flow), using classes and ids more effectively, and layouts and sizing to learn how to make the page more responsive to different screen sizes. It is a bit overwhelming to fix what I have so far and seems almost like it may be easier and beneficial to rebuild the website from scratch. Until then... here it is!</p>
