# Katie Meyer's Personal Website

Hi there! Welcome to my first repo that I made as a developer. The personal website was an opportunity for us to get familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS. You can learn a little bit about me here and see my first attempts at coding and understanding it. Although reluctant and embarrassed initially, I decided to leave my blog posts (weekly assignments during the first few weeks at Dev Bootcamp) so you can get a sense of my personality as a learner (and for me to look back on and laugh at myself, feeling good about how far I've come).

As I grow as a developer, I plan to keep this site up to date, adding recent projects, impressionable Meetups I attend, and maybe more blog posts!
