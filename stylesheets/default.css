/*I tried redoing my navigation bar. At first I had used a table in html to create the structure. But after some research, I determined a list would be better. I watched this video and now am a little stuck. I kept some elements form before that I thought I liked, but I would still like to get them centered in the middle. I feel like there has to be an easier way than futzing with the padding, height, and width? Before I had it responsive to the window size. Doesn't seem to be responding anymore. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovlvYH782c */
