##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
That there is still a lot I do not understand about it. It was frustrating because I thought I was beginning to grasp it, but then things started to happen that confused me, such as:
- as I changed the padding of one element it moved an element below it rather than the element I wanted it to effect
- getting the border to wrap around the image; I couldn't figure out what made the border was so much longer than the image (though not long enough to fill whole screen as it would in static position)
- margins did not adjust when I thought I was declaring them to

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I feel like I am understanding it better, but I still really struggle with it! I tried to work within static and relative positioning because there isn't anything at the moment that I want to be outside the natural flow of the page. I thought I could figure out how to position my elements using static and relative. I found it very hard. At the same time, I also want it to be responsive to screen size. Aiming for it to be responsive may be the piece that is tripping me up and I should read more or watch more videos about that topic.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Changing the font and color made me feel better about the look of the page. I enjoyed styling the border and choosing colors that were complementary and pleasing to my eyes. It was cool to see some of my css responsively adapting as I made the browser window larger and smaller. I also enjoyed playing with the stylistic differences for links - link, visited, hover.

Positioning was most frustrating. I spent a lot of time reading about it and watching different videos, seeing different exmamples to understand. I also spent time tinkering in the chrome-devtools/css-positioning.html link and talked to two friends who are newbie developers (who also struggle with positioning). I was determined to crack the code when working on my website! I still am determined to grasp this, but may need to change my approach.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that making a list is the way to go about making a navigational bar. This was frustrating at first as I was working with it written in table format in html. Once I watched a video about making navigation bars, I started to have a look closer to what I wanted, but it also opened up a whole new can of worms with padding, margins, and the border. Ay.

Having no prior experience with HTML before these past 3 weeks, I am a little unclear about the best practice use of <div>, <span>, and how much styling is okay to do in HTML. It is hard for me to discern if resources are adhering to older html format or newer.
