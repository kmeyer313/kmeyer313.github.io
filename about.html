      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a small town west of Chicago surrounded by a wonderful family that takes advantage of every opportunity to get together. In 2005, I moved to Milwaukee where I earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education and in history from Marquette University. Following graduation, I taught 5th grade at a progressive parochial school in Milwaukee where my passion for research-based best practice in education was both fostered and challenged.</p>
      <p>After teaching for 5 years, my desire to work in education grew beyond the walls of a school building. I did not enjoy teaching or planning curriculum anymore, but found that my side projects brought me greater fulfillment. On the side I was trying to find and build technological tools that could warehouse school-wide curriculum, that supported planning, and that simplified communication and collaboration.</p>
      <p>At the time I didn’t exactly know what arena my side projects fell into until I stumbled upon Instructure, an educational software company. My school’s technology integration specialist had asked me to look into Instructure’s learner management system, Canvas, for use at our school. I quickly found myself on their Careers page scanning job opportunities, wondering what skills I had that could be useful to them. I had no idea what a software engineer was, but as I learned, I realized they had the skills I needed to make better technological tools in education.</p>
      <p>Soon after I found out about Instructure, I learned about coding bootcamps. Dev Bootcamp was most appealing to me as it focuses not only on the technical skills I want to develop, but also on metacognitive skills to learn new skills after bootcamp and it fosters growth in emotional intelligence. It became very clear what direction I wanted to take next to develop the skills to make beautiful and meaningful software for education and other fields.</p>

      <h3>Interests/Hobbies</h3>
      <p>Aside from my career-focused passions and family get-togethers, I love traveling, learning about different cultures, whale watching, mountains, yoga, thinking, learning, reading, working out, playing sand volleyball, ballroom dancing, singing, and watching the Bears, Packers (yep, 10 years in Wisconsin can do that do you), and Cubs.</p>
